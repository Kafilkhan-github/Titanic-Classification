# Titanic-Classification
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger would survive or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes passenger information like name, age, gender, ticket class, cabin, embarked port, and survival status.
